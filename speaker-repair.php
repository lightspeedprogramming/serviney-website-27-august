                            How do Speakers work?
                        </h4>
                        <p><i>We’ll let you know how to speaker works in your mobile devices. Speakers are in form of transmitting the sort of electrical signal into an audible sound for us to hear. When fluctuating electric current flows through the coil in the speaker, it changes into a temporary electromagnet; this electromagnet is repelled and attracted to a permanent magnet found inside the speaker. As the coil moves, the drum or cone found on the outside of the speaker vibrates, pumping sound waves into the air.</i></p>
